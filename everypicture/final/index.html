        <h2>Creamsicle</h2>
        <p>The newest addition to Jay's plushie collectionâ€” a real-life recreation of the orange raccoon plushie from the video game Animal Jam.</p>
        <p>Possible motive: Being a newcomer, maybe it's jealous of the disproportionate attention Baby Bear gets from Jay...</p>
        <p>Seems shocked by the gruesome scene... but is her reaction genuine?</p>

        <p>He speaks for the trees. Seems to be comforting Creamsicle.</p>
        <p>Seems like a nice guy. Doesn't seem like the type to turn to violence... unless maybe to protect the environment</p>

        <h2>Dog/gie</h2>
        <p>One of two identical dog plushies (one named "Dog", one named "Gie"). Jay has long lost track of which one he is.</p>
        <p>They're turning their head away in grief and despair. It makes sense... he grew up with Baby Bear, and has known him the longest out of anyone here.</p>
        <p>They seem innocent... but then again, maybe they had a Brutus vs Julius Ceaser moment.</p>

        <p>What a gruesome coincidence that Aggie Mental Health Cow took their friend Desk Dragon out for a ride on the exact day Baby Bear was murdered.</p>
        <p>But maybe it wasn't a coincidence... Maybe the both of them did it.</p>
        <p>But you're not sure, since murder doens't seem good for one's Aggie mental health.</p>
