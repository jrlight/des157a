        <h3>Thoughts on article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> by Salim Ansari</h3>
        <p>
            "Best practices for form design" was a very good article! It was digestable, all the information felt useful, and I like the focus on accessibility and making forms simple to use. This focus reminds me of the principles of technical writing, which I took a class on last quarter— I think this article is great from a technical writing standpoint.

            It can be annoying design-wise to mark every required field on a form, but I read the article Ansari linked and now agree that is the best thing to do. I thought the tip on being very careful about what you auto-fill was very useful, as it was not something I had considered. I appreciate the personal anecdote he shared to show the problem. Contrary to the author, I do like when I need to type my proposed password twice before making an account— it makes me think, and I really don't want my password to be misspelled (yes, I could use a reset/recover password feature later, but that's increased work on my end that would just frustrate me). However, I absolutely agree that there should also be a show password button whenever you have to input a password.
