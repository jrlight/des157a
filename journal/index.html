            <h3>Game Design Research: Reflection on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/22/i-was-asked-to-invent-the-next-wordle-how-hard-could-it-be?ref=sidebar>">"I was asked to invent the next Wordle. How hard could it be?"</a> by David Shariatmadari</h3>
            <p>
                This article was a very interesting look at the whole mindset and process behind developing a game! The article is written in a personal tone. It starts off with giving a relatiely in-depth history of the game Wordle and its impact- especially its impact. This is give context for and hype up the request Shariatmadari gets- to develop a wordle-like game for his employer.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing that is especially interesting about the events described is that this game was created for a specifically requested, coorperate purpose. David Shariatmadari didn't wake up one day and go "I want to make a word puzzle game!", he was asked to make one by his employer because he had written an article analyzing a word puzzle game. I believe that this is why this article was an option for this assignment— we aren't making a site riffing off of the game of pig because we woke up and really wanted to do that, we're making this site because it's for an assignment. So this is a great article, showing how you can make something really fun and refreshing off of a coorperate request!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are various other takeaways I got from the article:
            </p>
            <p>
                - A principle that stuck with me was that a game should have a balance between luck and skill. Luck evens the playing field, and skill makes you feel like you have agency over the game. Above all, you want to avoid the feeling of getting cheated.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Playtesting is important! The quote "I think having people play around is 10 times more important than the idea" stuck with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Focusing on "make a better version of [thing]" is not conductive to game development.

            <h3>Thoughts on article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> by Salim Ansari</h3>
            <p>
                "Best practices for form design" was a very good article! It was digestable, all the information felt useful, and I like the focus on accessibility and making forms simple to use. This focus reminds me of the principles of technical writing, which I took a class on last quarter— I think this article is great from a technical writing standpoint.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can be annoying design-wise to mark every required field on a form, but I read the article Ansari linked and now agree that is the best thing to do. I thought the tip on being very careful about what you auto-fill was very useful, as it was not something I had considered. I appreciate the personal anecdote he shared to show the problem. Contrary to the author, I do like when I need to type my proposed password twice before making an account— it makes me think, and I really don't want my password to be misspelled (yes, I could use a reset/recover password feature later, but that's increased work on my end that would just frustrate me). However, I absolutely agree that there should also be a show password button whenever you have to input a password.
